\usage{
citation_network_plot(
  citations,
  cited_only,
  stages,
  root_source,
  label_only_cited = FALSE,
  color_plot = TRUE,
  custom_plot = FALSE,
  arrow_gap = 0.015,
  time_axis = "x",
  seed = 324
)
}
\arguments{
\item{citations}{A dataframe representing classified citations such as that generated by \code{\link[classify_citations()]{classify_citations}}.}

\item{cited_only}{A dataframe representing the works that are only cited by---not citing---the other works in \code{citations}.  This need only be specified if multiple classifications are employed (e.g., "agree" and "disagree") and not all of the only-cited works fall into the first classification.  Otherwise, this information will be automatically generated from \code{citations}.}

\item{color_plot}{Should multiple classifications be denoted by different colors?  If not, they will indicated by different shapes.}

\item{custom_plot}{Should the function return a bare plot suitable for customization using \code{\link[ggnetwork]{ggnetwork}} functions?}

\item{arrow_gap}{A parameter that will shorten the arrows that link works in order to avoid overplotting the dots that represent the works; larger values may be desirable if \code{custom_plot} is set to TRUE and the size of the dots will be increased using \code{\link[ggnetwork]{ggnetwork}}'s \code{\link[geom_nodes]{geom_nodes}} function.}

\item{time_axis}{Set to "y" to specify that time should start from the bottom of the plot or "x", the default, to specify that time flows from left to right.}

A ggplot object

\description{
\code{citation_network_plot} generates plots of citation networks, depicting works as dots ("nodes", in network parlance) and citations as arrows ("edges") from cited works to citing works.
