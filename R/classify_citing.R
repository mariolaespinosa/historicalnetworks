#' Open Scanned Versions of Potentially Citing Works for Classification
#'
#' \code{classify_citing} opens the Internet Archive's scanned versions of each potentially citing work in a dataframe generated by `find_citing`, highlighting the potential citations
#' 
#' @param df A dataframe representing downloaded texts (the "citing works") generated by `find_citing`
#' @param save_dir The directory in which to save the csv file that records the user's classifications.  This file will have the name "classify_[object specified as df].csv".
#'  
#' @details
#' `classify_citing` facilitates the process of confirming that the potential citing works returned by `find_citing` actually do contain citations to the cited works.  
#' Such hand-checking is necessary because the `find_citing` function casts a broad net for citing works, returning all works that include the cited work's author that were published in or after the cited work's year of publication.
#' When `classify_citing` runs, it opens the Internet Archive's online, scanned version of each citing work (in order by author then date) in the default browser and displays all matches for a cited work. 
#' The user can then classify whether the potential citation is a false positive or a duplicate work, or rather an actual citation (perhaps with an additional qualification, such as "disagreeing").
#' As indicated by the prompt, after this determination has been made, the user should enter it and press the [return] key to proceed to the next potential citation.
#' 
#' Although classifications can be entered as text (e.g., "false positive", "disagreeing"), a coding scheme such as the following can make the process easier:
#' 
#'  -1 duplicate source or similar later edition
#'  0  false positive
#'  1  agreeing with cited work or treating cited work as authority
#'  2  disagreeing with cited work 
#' 
#' The entered classifications are returned as a new variable named `classification` and are saved as an `R` script named "classify_[object specified as df].R" in the directory specified in the `save_dir` argument.
